% Here you should set up control points for curve segment A and draw
% the curve using your Bezier spline function. The curve should start at  
% point P1 and end at point P2
%
% Add the new control points into the matrix Control above. And access
% them in the same was we access coordinates from the Points matrix, e.g.  
%
%  C1=Control(:,1)
% 
% where column 1 of the Control matrix holds the coordinates for control
% point C1.

% Here you should set up multiple interpolation points and control points
% corresponding to the outer arc. The curve starts at P1 and ends at P4. 
% We need two additional interpolation points P2 and P3 where the curve 
% touches the line y=0 and the line x=A, where A is picked so that the 
% curve looks ok.

% Set up the control points needed to draw the inner arc. Now it is enough 
% to use one additional interpolation point to determine where the curve 
% should tangent the line x=B. It is required that B>A or the inner arc
% will cross the outer one.
